## Javascript games for the school internet with blacklists
The main focus of this project is making games with javascript for students that have a school internet that bans non-educational content and then publishing them using Github Pages. Most of the schools don't ban github because it is educational.
# Notice: I am not going to start working on this project until eighter the schools open or the date when they open gets public.(In Turkey)
